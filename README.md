# Killarney National Park

Situated in the south west of the island, Killarney National Park is one of the most biodiverse places in Ireland, and is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. As well as possessing varied and breathtaking scenery, the park has major historical significance too. Not only was it the first national park in Ireland but it is also home to a beautiful example of Victorian architecture in the form of Muckross House and Gardens, complete with a working traditional farm. 
 
Because there is so much to see and do in the park, visitors can be overwhelmed by the choices. The aim of this website is to clearly outline the most important areas to visit, the ways in which the park can be traversed, and as a way of getting in contact should anyone have any questions.
